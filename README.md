# sentry-self-hosted-ansible

This is an experiment to see how far i can go with ansible and how much effort it is to convert the bash centric repo of Sentry.

## Prerequisites
* Ansible 6
* Docker 20.10.21
* Time

Things might work with older versions, i haven't tested those, and frankly i'm not going to.

## Installation
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force
```
